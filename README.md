# AtliQ-Grands-Hospitality-Project

## Power BI Project: Hospitality Sector Insights üè®üìä

## Project Overview

AtliQ Grands is a luxury 5-star hotel chain with locations in Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, and Bangalore. Despite its premium reputation, the chain has been experiencing challenges with declining revenue and market share. To address these issues, I utilized Power BI to analyze their data and deliver actionable insights aimed at driving growth and profitability.

This project involves the development of three dynamic dashboards that focus on key performance metrics and provide clear, actionable recommendations for AtliQ Grands.

## Dashboards Developed

### 1. **Home View**  
The **Home View** serves as the entry point to the dashboard. It features a visually engaging display of **AtliQ Grand's photo** and provides a high-level summary of the other dashboards, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### 2. **Performance View**  
The **Performance View** offers an overview of essential hotel metrics, including:
- **Revenue**: Breakdown of earnings from various sources.
- **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)**: Measures the efficiency of room revenue generation.
- **Occupancy Rates**: Tracks how well rooms are being utilized.
- **Guest Satisfaction**: Analyzes customer feedback to help improve service quality.

This view is designed to help hotel management understand the overall performance of the brand across various key metrics.

### 3. **Revenue & Booking View**  
The **Revenue & Booking View** dives deeper into specific revenue streams and booking behavior, offering insights such as:
- **Revenue Trends by City**: Performance breakdown across different hotel locations.
- **Hotel Category Analysis**: Insights into the performance of various room categories and services.
- **Booking Platforms Comparison**: Analyzes performance across multiple booking platforms (e.g., OTAs vs. direct bookings).
- **Booking Behavior & Cancellations**: Identifies patterns in bookings, cancellations, and customer preferences.
- **Guest Segmentation**: Analyzes guest profiles to uncover trends in booking habits and demographics.

This dashboard enables management to make informed decisions on pricing, marketing, and overall strategy to maximize profitability.

## Skills Applied & Developed

This project allowed me to apply and develop a variety of skills in business intelligence and data analysis:
- **Data Visualization**: Creating clear, impactful visualizations that communicate complex data effectively.
- **Revenue & Booking Analysis**: Understanding key hospitality metrics like RevPAR, ADR, and occupancy rates.
- **Power BI Techniques**: Mastering interactive reports, slicers, and drillthrough functionalities for user-friendly navigation.
- **DAX & Hospitality Metrics**: Utilizing advanced DAX functions to calculate custom metrics and insights specific to the hospitality industry.

## Key Insights & Recommendations

In the **YouTube video presentation**, I walk through the key insights and actionable recommendations derived from the dashboards. These insights are designed to help AtliQ Grands improve its market position, enhance guest engagement, and boost profitability by making data-driven decisions across operations.
